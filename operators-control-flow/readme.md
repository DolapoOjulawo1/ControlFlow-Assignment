Question 1.  List the symbols for each of the below Javascript operators
a.  Arithmetic Operators
b.  Assignment Operators
c.  Comparison Operators
d.  Logical Operators
e.  Bitwise Operators

Answers
a.  The symbols used for Arithmetic Operators are:
        + Addition
        - Subtraction
        * Multiplication
        / Division
        % Modulo Operator
       ** Exponentiation Operator
       ++ Increment Operator
       -- Decrement Operator

b.  The symbols used for Assignment Operators:
        = The assignment operator
       += addition assignment operator
       -= subtraction assignment operator
       *= multiplication assignment operator
       /= division assignment operator.

c.  The symbols used for Comparison Operators:
        The Symbols for the Relational Operators are;
            > Greater than
           >= Greater than or equal to
            < Less than
           <= Less than or equal to
        The Symbols for the Equality Operators;
        ===
        The Symbols for Not Equals Operators; 
        !==

d. The symbols used for Logical Operators:
        && Logical AND
        || Logical OR
         ! NOT Operator

e. The symbols used for Bitwise Operators:
        &	bitwise AND
        |	bitwise inclusive OR
        ^	bitwise XOR (exclusive OR)
        <<	Zero fill left shift
        >>	Signed right shift
       >>>  Zero fill right shift
        ~	bitwise NOT


Question 2: For each JavaScript Operator, write 2 examples.
a. Arithmetic Operators
   Example 1.  let m = 25;
               let n = 10;
               console.log(m + n);

    Example 2. let m = 8;
               console.log(++m);


b.  Assignment Operators
   Example 1.  let r = 75;
               let s = 5;
               console.log(r += s);

   Example 2.  let p = 23;
               let t = 7;
               console.log(p *= t);
               

c.  Comparison Operators
   Example 1:  let x = 5;
               console.log( x < 5);
c
   Example 2:  let y = 5;
               console.log(y <= 5);


d. Logical Operators
   Example 1:   const a = true, b = false
                console.log(a || b); 

   Example 2:   const c = true, d = false;
                console.log(!c);


e.  Bitwise Operators
    Example 1:  let a = 12; 
                let  b = 25; 
                result = a | b; 
                console.log(result);

    Example 2:  let g = 12; 
                let  h = 25; 
                result = g ^ h; 
                console.log(result); 


Question 4: What is the result when the following program is executed?

                for (let i = 1; i < 20; i += 7) {
                    console.log(i);
                }
